 - QtWebKit will no longer support any QImageIO plugin with the Size option,
   but instead only decode formats that have been whitelisted. If you are
   using QtWebKit for controlled content and wish to override the white list
   it can now be done with the environment variable
   QTWEBKIT_IMAGEFORMAT_WHITELIST which takes a comma-separated list of
   QImageIO formats.
